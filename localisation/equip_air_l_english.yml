 hyperdrive:0 "Improved Hyperdrives"
 hyperdrive_desc:0 "The Hyperdrive, Known to almost every species of the galaxy, and widely recognized as one of the cornerstones of space flight, is absolutely necessary for any planet, nation, or faction wishing to take their first steps into a larger world. It allows for traveling 120,000 light years of distance in a matter of days, and enables societies like the Republic to control and influence large swathes of space with vast and powerful Navies. Smaller ships, such as fighters, don’t have one, and only the most advanced prototypes are outfitted with a hyperdrive."
 proton:0 "Proton Bombs"
 proton_desc:0 "Proton bombs were powerful explosive weapons carried by bomber craft such as BTL-B Y-wing starfighters and Hyena droid bombers. The bombs themselves could also be used as high-yield explosives capable of producing great damage to heavily armored vehicles such as AT-TEs."

 jet_tac_bomber_equipment_desc:0 "Their turrets and fixed guns allowed them to engage and destroy multiple targets simultaneously, making them effective in combat missions against enemy starfighters. Their heavy weapons payload allowed them to carry large amounts of ordnance, whether they be solid projectiles like proton torpedoes or gravity weapons like the electro-proton bomb."

 fighter_equipment_0:0 "Aurek-class Tactical Strikefighter"
 fighter_equipment_0_short:0 "Aurek-class Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Aurek fighter was a 9.2-meter-long delta-shaped starfighter armed with two heavy laser cannons and two proton torpedo launchers, capable of holding six torpedoes. The fighter was capable of considerable acceleration and maneuvering, and had variable-geometry wings. They were easily refuelable and rearmable, thus driving down costs."
 fighter_equipment_1:0 "Light Attack Fighter Model 250"
 fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Model 250 Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The design was reasonably maneuverable, and capable of extended patrols of up to 48 hours, but shielding, speed, and hull armor were no more than moderate. In particular, the design's weapons loadout was light, consisting of just a pair of light laser cannons. While suitable for police work, the '250 was no match for well-equipped fighters."
 fighter_equipment_2:0 "Light Attack Fighter Model 500"
 fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "Model 500 Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The HLAF-500 retained the basic LAF-250 fighter platform, but replaced the underpowered drives with SoroSuub 9X2 fusial thrust engines, and supplemented the original armament of twin lasers with extra weapons hardpoints, normally outfitted with a pair of proton torpedo launchers. The upgraded fighter also boasted slightly improved shields and maneuverability."
 fighter_equipment_3:0 "A-9 Vigilance Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "A-9 Fighter"
 fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The A-9 was armed with two laser cannons, mounted in a structure on the ventral side of the fuselage. One was slightly more powerful than the other. They were fire-linked and aimed forward in their standard configuration, but several modifications existed which allowed the gun to pivot 90 degrees down to perform strafing runs, as well as allowing the cannons to be independently targeted."
 tac_bomber_equipment_0:0 "B-28 Extinction-class Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_0_short:0 "B-28 Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_0_desc:0 "The B28 Extinction-class bomber, also referred to as the B-28, was a starfighter class used by the reconstituted Sith Empire in the Great Galactic War and during the Cold War."
 tac_bomber_equipment_1:0 "FD-75 Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_short:0 "FD-75 Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "The FD-75 employed some types of projectile weapons, such as proton bombs, concussion missiles, proton torpedoes, or thermal detonators to attack their targets, rather than energy weapons such as blasters."

 tac_bomber_equipment_2_short:0 "FD-80 Adv Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_2_desc:0 "The FD-80 employed some types of projectile weapons, such as proton bombs, concussion missiles, proton torpedoes, or thermal detonators to attack their targets, rather than energy weapons such as blasters."

 tac_bomber_equipment_3_short:0 "Scurrg H-6 Bomber"
 tac_bomber_equipment_3_desc:0 "The H-6 was originally made for Naboo. However, the Naboo had no need for such a bomber and the creators widened thier market and began to sell rights on a galaxy wide scale."

 CAS_equipment_1:0 "CT-4 Interceptor"
 CAS_equipment_1_short:0 "CT-4 Interceptor"
 CAS_equipment_1_desc:0 "The CT-4 was designed to be equipped with advanced reconnaissance, communication and offensive capabilities. Touting the ability to immediately recognize enemy spacecraft from afar, the fast scout could then engage with its twin laser cannons or if faced with armored targets, release a volley of rockets. Its nimble outward appearance would fool some pilots but the scouts extreme maneuverability and velocity were a vital trade off for veteran pilots."

 jet_fighter_equipment_1:0 "T-65 X-wing Starfighter"
 jet_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "T-65 X-wing"
 jet_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "X-wings were reasonably maneuverable starfighters. They had two pairs of wing-like strike-foils, or S-foils, mounted at the rear of the craft on opposite sides. The foils on each side locked in place flush against each other; during combat, however, the foils were folded out to increase the spread coverage of the laser cannons mounted at the tips of the foils. This gave the craft its distinctive X-like appearance when viewed from the front or rear. The cannons on some earlier models could not be fired with the S-foils in locked position, perhaps as a safety feature. During hyperspace travel, the S-foils remained locked to conserve energy."
