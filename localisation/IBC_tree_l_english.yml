IBC.1.d:0 "Due to the war effort against the Confederacy of Independent Systems, we have taken out numerous loans amounting to several trillion credits from the InterGalactic Banking Clan required to pay for our ever-increasing army. However, the Bamking Clan, which also loans to the CIS with no interest, has recently vastly increased the amount of interest they will be charging us for our loans.\n\nSeveral Senators are calling for us to take swift action against the IBC for their clear side-picking."
IBC.1.a:0 "We need the credits, interest rate hikes or not."
IBC.1.b:0 "We can always find another source of credits. Stop the loans!"
IBC.2.t:0 "Republic stops loaning from us!"

IBC.7.t:0 "Separatist Propaganda on IBC datanet!"
IBC.7.d:0 "Last week, the InterGalactic Banking Clan's datanet was apparently compromised by an unknown source, exposing clients to propaganda urging secession from the Republic.\n\nIBC officials have scrambled to tell officials that only the message-exchange systems were compromised rather than the more tightly-guarded transaction channels."
IBC.7.a:0 "Disturbing."
IBC.8.t:0 "Banking Clan aligns with the Separatists!"
IBC.8.d:0 "The InterGalactic Banking Clan, led by San Hill of Muunilinst, has announced that the Separatist systems will have the full support of the Banking Clan and any systems under its control.\n\nHowever, it is expected that the Banking Clan will continue loaning to both the Republic and the Separatists, though interest rates for the Separatists will be much lower, if they exist at all."
