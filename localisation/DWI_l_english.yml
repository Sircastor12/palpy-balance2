#Events
DWI.1.d:0 "Preparations are being made as we speak for the upcoming crusades. We will not only show plain superiority, we will secure dominion. Soon it will be time, but how could they be started if we were not to call upon our brothers in arms! We ask you, join us and continue your valiant efforts by our side."
DWI.2.d:0 "After a hard-fought battle Death Watch has finally proven victorious over the Duchess' men. Though lacking in numbers, they were able to show them their superiority and shatter the "New Mandalorian" pacifist delusions. Mandalore is a not like Concordia however, the homeland may have been reconquered, but not everyone is pleased with this abrupt return to tradition. Vizsla will now have to cement his rule and unite our people if he wishes to show the galaxy the might of Mandalore."
DWI.3.d:0 "A "grand future" is what Vizsla said to be expecting for our people at his latest speech. Since the war for Mandalore was won Vizsla and his advisors have been working tirelessly on showing all Mandalorians the truth and how the only way forward is to return to tradition. It seems their labour has bore fruit. All over the planet Mandalorians now wave their flags with pride and the latest event saw the movement of millions marching together to Vizsla's rally. However one cannot help to see a suspicious amount of pro-pacifists have disappeared..."
DWI.4.d:0 "Placeholder"
DWI.5.d:0 ""Proud Mandalorians. True Mandalorians. This is what we are and this is what we have shown the galaxy to be. It is impossible to put in words how overjoyed I am to see us reclaim our heritage in the grandest way possible." Vizsla spoke at the ceremonial formation of the Mandalorian Empire. \n\nOur Mand'alor showed emotion unlike in any of his previous speeches. It is evident that this moment is great not only for him, but for all of us."
DWI.6.d:0 "The war for control over Mandalore has recently begun, armies on both sides are prepared to fight for their ideals. The future of Mandalore now has two ways to go. \n\nVizsla, leading the war for Death Watch, is fast at work in the war chamber and was seen making a quick roar to inspire his people before the offensive begins: "Mando'ade! The time has come! The pacifists have tainted our homeland long enough. Today we will show our right and tomorrow we will return home.""
DWI.7.d:0 "The war for control over Mandalore has recently begun, armies on both sides are prepared to fight for their ideals. The future of Mandalore now has two ways to go. \n\nThe radical Death Watch are threatening the peace on Mandalore. Even though the New Mandalorians have advocated for peace and words rather than war and battle, this does not mean that their warrior spirit has left. It will surely be bloody."
DWI.8.d:0 "Wonderful news! Our brethren have not only responded to us, but they have already arrived, ready to head into combat. As long as we can be so united as this there is surely no way victory is a question. The Neocrusaders were welcomed this morning by Vizsla himself and are already being filled in on the plans. \n\nOur future is bright dear readers!"
DWI.9.d:0 "Shameful. Earlier we wrote a request to several Neocrusader groups but none have even dare respond, let alone accept our gracious offer. We will have to head into this battle on our own and maybe that is for the better.\n\nTo think we saw them as our brothers... No, they are but distant cousins."
DWI.11.d:0 "The rebel forces of Concordia have been beaten! Our forces have broken through and captured the enemy stronghold in Tarre. As we speak the entire moon is being scoured for any traitors to be brought to justice, but worryingly some prominent enemy leaders have gone missing. Let's hope nothing will come of it."
