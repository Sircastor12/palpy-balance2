swcw.1.title:0 "Doravalla Incident"
swcw.1.desc:0 "A convoy of peaceful Trade Federation vessels carrying vast amount of Iommite Ore, and a small shipment of extremely valuable Aurodium have been attacked by organised pirates in the Dorvalla system. Estimated to have a value of over 60,000 credits, Viceroy Nute Gungray made an impassioned speech earlier this morning on reforms believed necessary to prevent another attack. Nemodia has made nenewed calls for the relaxing of weapons restrictions imposed by the Russan reformation, as well as an introduction of trade route taxation in the outer rim systems to halt the spread of these pirates. These demands will be heard on the senate floor later this week, in which Chancellor Valorum will comment on the issue."

swcw.2.title:0 "Naboo Crisis Escalates!"
swcw.2.desc:0 "A trade dispute between the galactic trade federation and the Naboo government has culminated in a full-blown blockade of the planet. In a show of weakness for a collapsing Valorum government, the Republic has neglected to dispatch a peacemaker force. Calls have rung throughout the senate for an impromptu election for the position of chancellor, and it'll later come to be in the upcoming months."
swcw.3.title:0 "Valorum Responds"

swcw.12.desc:0 "The Senate chambers filled with loud outcries of protest and dismay yesterday morning following Senator Garm Bel Iblis' surprise announcement that Corellia would close its borders and pull out of the Military Creation Act vote. "The Corellian sector, one of the founding fathers of the Republic, is not seceding," stressed Bel Iblis. "However, Corellia will not participate in what it deems a profound error that threatens its sovereignty." 1/nAfter the announcement, Bel Iblis and his retinue left the Senate Hall under heavily armed CorSec escort who pushed aside journalists and critical Senators. Bel Iblis refused comment. The Senator left Coruscant, reportedly for Corellia."

blockade.1.d:0 "The Royal Queen of Naboo desperately needs the help of the Galactic Republic. The Queen has accused the Trade Federation of illegally blockading, and invading her homeworld. She claims that many of her people are starving and many will die if the Trade Federation is not forced to back down."
blockade.4.d:0 "I will not defer...I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed. I move for a vote of no confidence...in Chancellor Valorum's leadership."
blockade.15.d:0 "Finis Valorum has been removed from power and an election has been held in the senate to appoint his successor. Senator Palpatine of Naboo has been chosen as the new Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic."

cis.2.desc:0 "Oppressed citizens. I am Count Dooku of Serreno. Once a Jedi Knight, I have seen the Galactic Republic, and its Senate become abominations. They lounge in luxury on Coruscant, while you toil and languish.From this day forward, I devote my life to building a new government. The new government I will create will correct the Republic's failures.\nThis will be the beginning of great strife and turmoil. After all, the Republic and Jedi will not surrender power willingly.  No longer will we be spat upon by people who are supposed to represent our interests. They didn't hear our pleas, now they will hear our judgment. May the Force be with us all."

Their freedom to choose one master over the other can hardly be called liberty. Likewise, their freedom to elect their leaders is a false choice, as propaganda would never allow the true socialists to take power. A people so thoroughly indoctrinated can only be saved by a [Root.GetAdjective] intervention.'\n\n[Root.GetLeader] has polemicized against the government in [From.GetName] for a long time in party meetings, but this rhetoric is now used more frequently in public. There is little reason to believe that this conflict could be resolved peacefully."

In strengthening their own power at the price of the international revolution, they have shown that they care little for the ideals they claim to hold. We must bring the true revolution to them.'\n\nAlthough initially supportive of the [From.GetAdjective] revolution, [Root.GetLeader] has expressed increased disappointment with how it has developed.

It is only a matter of time until they strike against us or our allies. Let us strike first.'\n\nNo one has expected less than mutual contempt between us and the [From.GetAdjective], but the animosity has intensified lately.

 war_justification.10.d:0 "'It is with heavy heart that we must confront the reality of our situation: An invasion of [From.GetName] may be our only recourse. It is of too great a strategic advantage to attempt any other solution in our current situation. Although we trust that neither the [Root.GetAdjective] nor the [From.GetAdjective] people want war, but history has led us to this point and our options are limited. We can only hope that through this assertion of our military power, we can avoid further bloodshed in the future.'\n\nAlthough it is a popular theory that democracies do not go to war against other democracies, recent developments have pointed to a [Root.GetAdjective] invasion of [From.GetName] in the future. History may surprise us yet."
 war_justification.10.a:0 "[From.GetName] is a dubious democracy anyway."
 war_justification.11.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Speaks Against Red Menace"
 war_justification.11.d:0 "'Without a doubt, [From.GetName] communism is one of the greatest threats to liberty and order in this era. Relentless and ruthless, it threatens to devour not only the [From.GetAdjective] people's hope of a prosperous, democratic society, but that of its neighbors as well. If we do not act now, we may well see this first domino fall too late, leaving more failed social experiments in its wake. How many more need die before we intervene?'\n\nThe threat of subversive activity undermining our democracy, fueled by [From.GetAdjective] ambitions, has become a hotly debated topic recently. While representatives in opposition have called this a Red Scare aimed at pursuing war with [From.GetName], the rhetoric of the [Root.GetRulingParty] has been highly successful so far."
 war_justification.11.a:0 "They follow a violent ideology, what reaction can they expect but violence?"
 war_justification.12.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Confronts [From.GetAdjective] Fascism"
 war_justification.12.d:0 "'In modern history, perhaps even in history as a whole, there has been no worse tyranny than the iron grip in which [From.GetRulingParty] now holds [From.GetName]. People may argue that we should not provoke conflict, that we should trust [From.GetLeader] to honor treaties and promises in the future, but these people fail to see that treaties made under the reign of fascism are useless. To these dishonorable liars, might makes right, and the paper on which an agreement is written burns just as easily as the books of their detractors.'\n\nPeople who have long hoped to avoid a direct confrontation with [From.GetName] have now been strongly opposed by [Root.GetLeader], who argues that we in Machiavellian terms are merely postponing war to the advantage of the enemy. At this rate, we may strike the first blow after all."
 war_justification.12.a:0 "There can be no peace in our time until they are gone."
 war_justification.13.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Calls for War Against [From.GetName]"
 war_justification.13.d:0 "'Although we may be a peaceful people, our nature alone does not determine the course we must take in history. This is a time of war. For too long, the [From.GetAdjective] have possessed the means that we need to make it through the trials we may face, and it's apparent that they will not part with them peacefully. Despite our best efforts to build a modern state, some matters can only be settled through the old trials of battle.'\n\n[Root.GetLeader]'s hostile rhetoric towards [From.GetName] has gone to great lengths to justify an invasion. Some portion of the population support this course, but the decision lies in the lands of our leader."
 war_justification.13.a:0 "It may be a difficult decision, but we must stand behind it."
 war_justification.14.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Challenges [From.GetAdjective] Pretensions"
 war_justification.14.d:0 "'[From.GetName] may think themselves more modern and advanced than us, but the truth is that their nation has not been tested as ours has, nor are they prepared for the threats now plain to see on the horizon. By their disdain towards us, and preventing us to seize that which is rightfully ours, they have made us one of those threats to themselves. Their weak and divided nation will hardly resist our claims.'\n\nThe derisive opinion of [From.GetName] long held by the [Root.GetRulingParty] has developed from criticism to hostility. Although popular opinion is that the [From.GetAdjective] people want to avoid war, [Root.GetLeader] claims that their elected leaders have provoked it through their arrogance."
 war_justification.14.a:0 "They do not know how strong our hardships have made us."
 war_justification.15.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Wants to Restore Order in [From.GetName]"
 war_justification.15.d:0 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] national spirit is strong, but not all nations are so fortunate. [From.GetName] has had its traditions destroyed and rightful rulers long since murdered and buried, all in the name of the idea of the great Marxist revolution. It is our duty to restore order to this world led astray by bloodthirsty usurpers and to assert the strength of [Root.GetName] against this threat.'\n\nWhile the [Root.GetRulingParty] has always opposed communism, [From.GetName] has been a target of particular attacks in recent speeches. Whether or not the attack on the [Root.GetAdjective] nation from communists is a real threat, the preemptive attack on [From.GetAdjective] communism is already in the works."
 war_justification.15.a:0 "Those murdered in the revolution will be avenged!"
 war_justification.16.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Calls Out [From.GetAdjective] Oppressors"
 war_justification.16.d:0 "'My opponents would have you believe that my rule is like that of the [From.GetRulingParty] in [From.GetName]. They could not be more wrong. While [From.GetLeader]'s successes are the result of a recent fad, a destructive mass movement bent on bullying other nations into submission, the [Root.GetRulingParty] stands in opposition to that movement as the ones who will not submit. I am prepared to do whatever is necessary to eliminate this threat, even if it means war.'\n\nThe [Root.GetLeader] regime has adopted a hostile policy towards the [From.GetAdjective] nation. Whatever our leaders may be called, fascist is a word reserved for our enemies."
 war_justification.16.a:0 "Tradition and pragmatism will always triumph over fanaticism and terror."
 war_justification.17.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Questions [From.GetAdjective] Sovereignty"
 war_justification.17.d:0 "'Who determines the borders of a nation and how are they determined? Whatever way people may have found in the past to justify where [Root.GetName] ends and [From.GetName] begins, we live in a new era. The strategic importance of this border cannot be overstated, and we are well within our rights to shift it to ensure the continued security of our people.'\n\nListening to [Root.GetLeader]'s recent speeches, an invasion of [From.GetName] appears imminent. Dissenting voices have objected, but public support for war is on the rise."
 war_justification.17.a:0 "We must rally behind this cause!"
 war_justification.18.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Questions the Motives of [From.GetName]"
 war_justification.18.d:0 "'There is no doubt that [From.GetName] is preparing for war. The changes in economic policy make it plain to see that the [From.GetAdjective] are not a people of peace, but rather waiting for the right opportunity to strike against us. Will we stand idly by and watch them arm themselves while [Root.GetName] is undefended? Or will we disarm this threat before it grows beyond our power?'\n\nThe hawks in the [Root.GetRulingParty] have turned their eyes towards [From.GetName], arguing that attack is the best defense. Their viewpoint is gaining traction and [Root.GetName] is preparing for war."
 war_justification.18.a:0 "At least through war, there will be an end to this conflict."
 war_justification.19.t:0 "[Root.GetLeader] Angered by [From.GetAdjective] Posturing"
 war_justification.19.d:0 "'Those naïve citizens of [Root.GetName] who imagine the [From.GetAdjective] as a people of peace are entirely out of touch with reality. Those who live at our border do not have the luxury of such delusions, seeing their troops closing in on us just across it. This is a threat we cannot leave unanswered. With every passing day, [From.GetName] is preparing for war. It would be madness for us not to do the same.'\n\nThe [From.GetAdjective] military presence close to our territory has sparked increased concern as this nation appears more and more to be the enemy of the [Root.GetRulingParty]. Whether it is the cause or the effect of their polemic is a matter of contention."
 war_justification.19.a:0 "Regardless, we must ready the people for war."

This is about safeguarding our children's futures and ensuring that [Root.GetName] has a place in the world tomorrow. This is a matter of devotion to our cause and the ideals we take for granted. It's time to act.'\n\nA series of rousing speeches from [Root.GetRulingParty] leaders, most prominently [Root.GetLeader], has been calling the public to support an invasion of [From.GetName]. The geopolitical motives behind the invasion are less prominent in the rhetoric to patriotic sentiments, but this campaign appears highly efficient in convincing the public of its necessity."
