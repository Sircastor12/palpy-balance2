REP_1000_years_of_peace_desc:0 "The Republic has stood as the galaxy's guiding light, its bastion of Democracy, and keeper of the peace for a millenium, and is, for the most part, just as strong as ever. However, there are clouds growing on the horizon. The Senate, always a bureaucratic mess, is growing ever more corrupt, and an upstart group of powerful corporations is threatening to break away from the Republic at the same time. Meanwhile, Chancellor Valorum, current leader of the Republic, is facing pressure from all sides of the political spectrum. It seems that the next few decades or even years will decide the Republic's fate in this new age."
REP_concessions_to_the_corporations:0 "Concessions to the Corporations"
REP_concessions_to_the_corporations_desc:0 "As much as it pains us to bend to the demands of the power hungry figures at the head of the Seperatist bloc, we can't afford for order in the galaxy to collapse.

REP_look_the_other_way_desc:0 "We've had a lot of suspicions that the large corporations that control much of the industry in the galaxy have been doing plenty of illegal things for quite some time, and investigations have been ongoing for a while as well. However, given our recent compromise with them and the agreement that came with it, it might be politically prudent to drop those investigations to gain their trust."
REP_anticorruption_stance:0 "Anti-Corruption Stance"
REP_anticorruption_stance_desc:0 "These filthy Capitalist Plutocrats have been let off the leash for far too long. It's high time we reined in these greedy corporations and remind them who's really in charge around here. We're already looking at new legislation that will target and punish them for any illegal practices."
REP_maintain_galactic_peace:0 "Maintain Galactic Peace"
REP_maintain_galactic_peace_desc:0 "Our recent move against the corporations, although certainly justified, has caused unrest throughout the galaxy. We need to send peacekeeping delegations to every region, every rim, every corner of our domain if we want the Republic to hold together."
REP_the_naboo_crisis:0 "The Naboo Crisis"
REP_the_naboo_crisis_desc:0 "In response to taxation of their trade routes. the Trade Federation has done the unthinkable- blockade Naboo, one of the most peaceful planets in the Republic and a standard-bearer of Democracy in the galaxy. The Senate has broken down into infighting between various factions, and Chancellor Valorum seems to have lost his head in this dark hour. We need a plan of action, and fast!"
REP_vote_of_no_confidence:0 "Vote of No Confidence"
REP_vote_of_no_confidence_desc:0 "Chancellor Valorum's ineptitude has been brought into the spotlight for all to see. He has done nothing to protect the starving people of Naboo, and hasn't even condemned the Trade Federation's dispicable act. It is time for us to get rid of him and replace him with someone more suited to the job of wartime leader. One of the Senators from Naboo, Sheev Palpatine, seems like a good choice."
REP_transition_of_power:0 "Transition of Power"
REP_transition_of_power_desc:0 "Now that Palpatine has been officially confirmed by the Senate, it is time for the people to see our new Chancellor. He is already showing all the marks of a strong, true, and charismatic leader, and will have a positive impact on our citizens' morale."
REP_promises_of_peace:0 "Promises of Peace"

REP_found_the_loyalist_committee_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Naboo Crisis, Seperatist propaganda and sentiment is cropping up all over the space lanes. Not only is this utter nonsense, it could also pose a real risk to our strength and stability if left unchecked. Creating a committee to deal with such problems is in our best interests."
REP_anticorruption_campaign:0 "Anti-Corruption Campaign"
REP_anticorruption_campaign_desc:0 "Under the Chancellors leading up to and including Valorum, the Senate and its surrounding bureacracy has grown more and more corrupt.

REP_judicial_police_reforms:0 "Judicial Police Reforms"
REP_judicial_police_reforms_desc:0 "It seems that our police aren't well equipped to deal with large scale civilian disturbances like the ones we have been experiencing lately. We need to reform their rules and guidelines to ensure they have a smooth relationship with the people of the Republic."

REP_chancellorship_elections:0 "Chancellorship Elections"
REP_chancellorship_elections_desc:0 "Although Chancellor Palpatine has only been in office for a short time, nevertheless it is time for an election once again. However, due to his tremendous popularity and success at navigating recent crises, it is expected that he wins in a landslide, if any dare to run against him."
REP_choose_a_vice_chair:0 "Choose a Vice Chair"
REP_choose_a_vice_chair_desc:0 "With Palpatine secure in his role as Chancellor, it is time to select a Vice Chair. It seems that there are only 3 options- Mas Ameda, who is popular with the core planets, Orn Free Taa an influential Outer Rim Senator from Ryloth, and Aang, who many see as a darkhorse candidate."
REP_choose_a_chief_of_staff:0 "Choose a Chief of Staff"
REP_choose_a_chief_of_staff_desc:0 "Now that a Vice Chair has been selected, it's time to look at the candidates for Chief of Staff. Sly Moore, the Umbaran, seems to be the front runner, while Bail Organa is being pushed by the more pacifist minded advisors to the Chancellor. Also in the running is Jar Jar Binks, because no one could disable, maim, or kill him before he signed the candidacy form."

REP_repeal_ruusan_desc:0 "The Ruusan Reformation was designed to limit the size of our military, specifically, the size of our flagships and cruisers, to prevent the Republic from becoming a warmongering totalitarian regime. While that's all fine and dandy in peacetime, we have a looming galactic conflict on our hands, and the time for caution is over. We need to be prepared and armed so we can crush any uprising that we might face. "
REP_rally_the_core_worlds:0 "Rally The Core Worlds"
REP_rally_the_core_worlds_desc:0 "Gaining support from the rich and influential Core Worlds in the upcoming conflict will go a long way in ensuring we have the upper hand when war breaks out. We'll need their industry, economies, and anything else we can squeeze out of them if we are to succeed."
REP_invest_in_the_core:0 "Invest in the Core"
REP_invest_in_the_core_desc:0 "One way to ensure the Core's support is to throw money at their problems. Building more houses, infrastructure, civilian job and entertainment centers- whatever it may be- the people of the Core planets will see that we care for them and in turn will care for us."
REP_invest_in_core_companies:0 "Grant financial aid to Core industries"
REP_invest_in_core_companies_desc:0 "Another way to get the Core in our corner is too gain the support of their large and influential industries by investing in their operations and properties. With the corporations secured, we can expect them to advance our interests on their base planets."
REP_dangerous_ideas_act:0 "Dangerous Ideas Act"
REP_dangerous_ideas_act_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, large portions of the Republic are becoming ever more hostile to Coruscant and the Senate. We need to take drastic action in the form of the Dangerous Ideas Act before this gets any worse, and although it won't gain us any friends, it certainly will lead to less enemies out in the open."
REP_increased_police_powers_act:0 "Increased Police Powers Act"
REP_increased_police_powers_act_desc:0 "Reports are coming in from planets both in the Rim and the Core that our police forces are being overwhelmed and lack the equipment necessary to deal with things as bad as large scale insurrections. We need to increase their funding and power to maintain local stability in the Republic."
REP_corporate_separatist_sanctions_act:0 "Corporate Separatist Sanctions Act"
REP_corporate_separatist_sanctions_act_desc:0 "Much of the problems related to civilian disturbances and unrest are being mirrored in, if not caused by, large corporations who think they'll make more money if they seceded from the Republic. Not only is this false, it's also something we need to deal with before it gets out of our control."
REP_galactic_surveillance_state:0 "Galactic Surveillance State"
REP_galactic_surveillance_state_desc:0 "Well it's unfortunate, we have no choice but to start playing Big Brother to the citizens of the Republic. Surveillance will be increased galaxy-wide, and punishments for anti-Republic sentiments and statements will be harshened. This is not going to sit well with many of our more liberal-minded citizens, but they have given us no other options."
REP_holofeed_crackdown:0 "Limit acceptable Holofeed information"
REP_holofeed_crackdown_desc:0 "Data has shown that anti-Republic propaganda is being spread through the very Holofeed network that we help support. Clever, yet a little too clever for our liking. We'll have to shut these ads down before they do any more damage."
REP_university_crackdown:0 "Crack down on University students"
REP_university_crackdown_desc:0 "Many of the main Core Universities have been spouting off nonsense about our regime ever since we started taking a harder stance on Dangerous Ideas. It's time we turned our attention to them and teach them a lesson unlike any they've seen before."
REP_republic_secret_police:0 "Found a Secret Police Organization"
REP_republic_secret_police_desc:0 "In order to truly eradicate anti-Republic sentiment and ideas, we need a police force suited for the task, one that won't be as public and legally bound as the pre-existing one. The day we found a Secret Police network will be a dark day for opponents of the Republic, and a glorious day for our Democracy!"
REP_coruscant_infrastructure:0 "Improve Coruscant's Infrastructure"
REP_coruscant_infrastructure_desc:0 "Through Coruscant flows everything vital to the success of the Republic- trade and money, politics, and orders for our fleets and armies. As such, we need to ensure it is capable of handling all kinds of movement, whether physical ships and goods, or data and communications. What all this means is infrastructure improvements are necessary."
REP_infrastructure_development_bill:0 "Infrastructure Development Bill"
REP_infrastructure_development_bill_desc:0 "With the infrastructure improvements to our capital planet finished, it is time to consider similar upgrades on strategically important worlds across the galaxy. Introducing the IDB is the first step in this direction."
REP_research_slot:0 "Increase Research Center Funding"
REP_research_slot_desc:0 "The Republic is already home to some of the most advanced research facilities in the galaxy, and we already have strong connections with their leading scientists. Granting them more funding will lead to benefits for us, them, and the Republic as a whole.."
REP_in_house_production:0 "In House Production"
REP_in_house_production_desc:0 "Buying ships from foreign producers isn't good enough. We need more ships, and we need them now. Producing our own designs is the only way we can keep up with the demand coming from fleet."
REP_establish_an_order_of_battle:0 "Establish an Order of Battle"
REP_establish_an_order_of_battle_desc:0 "Now that the baseline for our chain of command has been created, it's time to decide how to send those in command into battle. Establishing an order of battle is crucial to any army and we need one for success."
REP_execute_order_66:0 "Execute Order 66"
REP_execute_order_66_desc:0 "After years of lying in wait, watching, planning, orchestrating- Chancellor Palpatine has decided the time has come to reveal the Jedi's treasonous plot to overthrow the Senate, the Republic, and Democracy. With the Jedi being scattered across the galaxy leading various campaigns, the Chancellor has decided to execute one of the orders hardcoded into every clone via computer chip at birth- number 66. As soon as the order goes out, the Jedi will fall, ensuring the ascendance of the Republic, forever. Long live the Chancellor!"
REP_operation_knightfall:0 "Operation Knightfall"
REP_operation_knightfall_desc:0 "In response to Order 66 and the Jedi Purge, the remnants of the order have walled themselves off in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, planning to stage a desperate last defense. Operation Knightfall, to be carried out by the 501st and led by the Chancellor's right hand man Darth Vader, will put an end to these traitors once and for all."
REP_jedi_generalship_program:0 "Jedi Generalship Program"
REP_jedi_generalship_program_desc:0 "The Clones are capable soldiers, and their commanders and captains are born and bred to lead, but they're still lacking in a few areas. Attaching a Jedi to each Clone Division as a General will cover these deficiencies and benefit it in other ways as well."
REP_demilitarize_the_order:0 "Demilitarize the Order"
REP_demilitarize_the_order_desc:0 "The Jedi are meant to be keepers of the peace, not soldiers. We will demilitarize them to ensure they dont get to much freedom."
REP_keepers_of_the_peace:0 "Keepers of the Peace"
REP_keepers_of_the_peace_desc:0 "With the recent events that have occured across the galaxy, many are clamoring for the Jedi Order to take up their place once more the chief military branch of the Republic. However, they are mistaken. Jedi do not attack, nor do they retaliate. Jedi are keepers of the peace, and will remain as such until the end of time."
REP_warriors_of_the_republic:0 "Warriors of the Republic"
REP_warriors_of_the_republic_desc:0 "The threat to the Republic is too great to be ignored. The Jedi can no longer afford to sit back and watch the galactic conflicts unfold. As they say, sometimes the best defence is a good offense."
REP_a_disturbance_in_the_force:0 "A Disturbance in the Force"
REP_a_disturbance_in_the_force_desc:0 "There is something... happening. That is all we know. There has been a great disturbance in the Force, and yet none of us can detect what exactly it portends. We can only hope it isn't something that will be too disastrous for the order."
REP_the_great_jedi_purge:0 "The Great Jedi Purge"
REP_the_great_jedi_purge_desc:0 "In the aftermath of Order 66, there are still many Jedi loose in the galaxy. We need to hunt them down and ensure that there are no survivors left."
REP_shroud_of_darkness:0 "Shroud of Darkness"
REP_shroud_of_darkness_desc:0 "A veil has fallen over our ability to foresee what may happen in the future, or even what is occuring now on distant planets. This can only mean one thing. Somewhere, somehow, a powerful Sith Lord is acting against us from the Shadows."
REP_the_chosen_one:0 "The Chosen One"
REP_the_chosen_one_desc:0 "Despite it going against the rules and traditions of the Jedi Council, it is obvious that Anakin Skywalker is the Chosen One of the great prophecy and must be trained. May the force be with him, and may he bring balance to it and the galaxy."
REP_a_mobile_army:0 "A Mobile Army"
REP_a_mobile_army_desc:0 "It is clear the Clone Troopers are ill suited for a meat grinder style of combat. It goes against their training, and they're too difficult to replace. Instead, we must prioritize mobility and improvisation under fire. Not only will this give us tactical flexibility, it will play to our soldiers' strengths and limit our losses."
REP_infantry_tactics:0 "Infantry Tactics"
REP_infantry_tactics_desc:0 "With the activation and deployment of the Grand Army of the Republic, we suddenly have a massive group of divisions and soldiers to sned into battle. The only question is how- should we emphasize independence of thinking and movement, or keep it simple and just throw these Clones and the CIS lines?"
REP_chain_of_command:0 "Chain of Command"
REP_chain_of_command_desc:0 "Many of our new soldiers have received specialized training and other techniques designed to prepare them for leadership roles as lieutenants, commanders, and captains. It is crucial that we make good use of them, as they understand their fellow clones' way of thinking and fighting far better than we ever could."
REP_establish_the_naval_academy:0 "Establish the Naval Academy"
REP_establish_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "Although planets are conquered or defended by men on the ground, the battle often starts in the skies and space above. Ship to Ship combat will play a vital role in any Republic victory, and we need to ensure that the men leading our ships are the best of the best. Creating a school desgined to do just that is a good place to start the search for capable captains."
REP_a_diplomatic_solution:0 "A Diplomatic Solution"
REP_a_diplomatic_solution_desc:0 "Although we are currently... at odds with the CIS, there doesn't have to be a bloody end to this conflict. An influential group of Senators, headed by Padme Amidala and Bail Organa, are laready pushing for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, and perhaps they are right. Maybe we should try to find some diplomatic solution to this galactic problem."
REP_military_creation_act:0 "Military Creation Act"
REP_military_creation_act_desc:0 "Now that Chancellor Palpatine has been given emergency powers by the Senate, it's time that we put those powers to work. We are about to be plunged into a galaxy-wide war, and the only thing resembling a military we have are the Jedi, who are far too few to defend all of the Republic, those numbers are cut even shorter due to infighting on if the Jedi should be used as warriers. We need a proper military, and fast."
